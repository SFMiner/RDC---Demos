# Memory Discovery System Documentation

The Memory Discovery System allows players to organically discover personal stories and memories through observation and dialogue. This document explains how to use and expand this system.

## Core Components

1. **Memory Triggers** - Events that unlock memories when specific conditions are met
2. **Memory Chains** - Sequences of related memories that tell a complete story
3. **Observable Features** - Visual elements on characters/objects that players can notice
4. **Tag System** - Centralized and simplified system for persistent tracking of player discoveries and story progression
5. **Memory Tag Registry** - A centralized storage for memory tags (currently inactive but code remains for future use)

## Usage

### Adding Observable Features to NPCs

NPCs can have observable features that players can notice:

```gdscript
# In your NPC scene script
func _ready():
    # Add observable features
    add_observable_feature("necklace", "Poison's wearing a small metal vial necklace.")
    add_observable_feature("tattoo", "A small botanical illustration is tattooed on their wrist.")
```

### Creating Memory Data Files

Memory chains are defined in JSON files located in `data/memories/`. Each character can have their own file.

Example JSON structure:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "character_memory_chain",
    "character_id": "CharacterName",
    "relationship_reward": 10,
    "completed_tag": "memory_chain_completed",
    "steps": [
      {
        "id": "notice_feature",
        "trigger_type": 0, // LOOK_AT = 0
        "target_id": "CharacterName_feature",
        "unlock_tag": "feature_seen",
        "description": "Description text shown when discovered",
        "condition_tags": []
      },
      {
        "id": "ask_about_feature",
        "trigger_type": 3, // DIALOGUE_CHOICE = 3
        "target_id": "ask_feature_dialogue_id",
        "unlock_tag": "feature_discussed",
        "description": "Response from character",
        "condition_tags": ["feature_seen"]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Adding Conditional Dialogue

In dialogue files, you can use tag checks to conditionally show dialogue options:

```
~ start
Character: Hello there!

- Normal option
  Character: Normal response
  => END
- [if DialogSystem.can_unlock("feature_seen")] Ask about the thing you noticed
  Character: Oh, you noticed that?
  do DialogSystem.unlock_memory("feature_discussed")
  => END
```

### Trigger Types

The memory system supports various trigger types:

- `LOOK_AT` (0): Triggered when player observes a specific feature
- `ITEM_ACQUIRED` (1): Triggered when player obtains a specific item
- `LOCATION_VISITED` (2): Triggered when player visits a location
- `DIALOGUE_CHOICE` (3): Triggered when player selects a dialogue option
- `QUEST_COMPLETED` (4): Triggered when a quest is completed
- `CHARACTER_RELATIONSHIP` (5): Triggered when relationship level changes

## Tag System

The centralized tag system was recently updated and simplified:

- ~~All memory tags are registered in a central registry file~~ (registry feature is currently inactive but code remains for future use)
- Observable features are now fully functional, allowing players to notice visual elements on characters
- Tags are consistently tracked across game sessions through the GameState tag system
- Memory tags can be viewed and managed using the debug commands listed below

## Integration with Other Systems

The Memory System integrates with:

- **Dialogue System**: For conditional dialogue options based on discoveries (now with character-specific fonts)
- **Quest System**: For quest objectives based on memory discovery
- **Relationship System**: To award relationship points for memory discoveries
- **Phone Interface**: Content in apps can be filtered and unlocked based on memory tags

## Example Test Quest

See `data/memories/poison.json` and `data/dialogues/poison_memories.dialogue` for a complete example of the "Memories in the Thread" quest.

## Dev Commands

For debugging purposes, you can use:

```
# In-game console
memory_list                # Lists all memory chains
memory_set [tag]           # Manually sets a memory tag
memory_trigger [type] [id] # Manually triggers a memory
memory_reset               # Resets all memory progress
```
